# Objc-Fluid-Interfaces

This is an objective-c port of Nathan Gitter's [Fluid Interfaces](https://github.com/nathangitter/fluid-interfaces) repo.

It's an awesome project with an accompanying medium [article](https://medium.com/@nathangitter/building-fluid-interfaces-ios-swift-9732bb934bf5).
In addition to getting more experience with objc, I got a lot more exposure working with various UIKit components. 

Overall, a super fun project... I highly recommend checking out Nathan's original implementation!
